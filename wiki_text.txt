Mods are modifications to the Minecraft game that make it behave differently. Sometimes they're small, like a minor graphical change; sometimes they're big, like adding new blocks and items; and sometimes they're unfair, like x-ray. In an effort to ensure that Autcraft is a safe and fair place to play, where everyone has similar experiences and opportunities, only some mods are allowed. This is a list of all of the mods currently allowed to be used on the Autcraft server. If a mod you want to use is on this list, please read the entire section for that mod so that you can see if there are any parts of that mod that are disallowed. If there is a mod that you want to use that is not on this list, please see if it has been suggested before and if not, suggest it on [https://www.autcraft.com/forum/m/16338872/viewforum/3071549 the forums] and don't use it unless it is put on this list.

Note: If a mod on this list requires another mod to work, that mod is also allowed.

== Mod loaders ==

Most mods use either the Fabric or Forge mod loader. To use a mod, you'll usually have to install the mod loader first.

=== How to Install Fabric ===
# Download the Fabric installer from [https://fabricmc.net/use/ fabricmc.net/use]. Use the Windows/.EXE method if you are on Windows, or the universal method if you're on another platform (or don't like the SmartScreen warning). Note that to open the .jar file, you'll need to install Java first which you can do from [https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot adoptopenjdk.net].
# Open the file that you downloaded. If done correctly, the installer window should appear.
# Select the Minecraft version you want to use.
# Click "Install"
# Open the Minecraft launcher (closing it first if it was already open).
# A new Fabric installation profile should appear. Select it, put the mods you want to use into a "mods" folder in your Minecraft directory (instructions on how to find it [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/.minecraft here]), and you're ready to play!

=== How to Install Forge ===
# Download the installer for the version of Forge for the Minecraft version you want to use from [https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/ files.minecraftforge.net]. Note that clicking on the download link will take you to an ad page before letting you download the file, do NOT click on anything on that page except for the "Skip" button at the top-right! If you did that correctly, you should get a file called something like `forge-<minecraft_version>-<forge_version>-installer.jar`.
# To open the .jar file, you'll need to install Java first which you can do from [https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot adoptopenjdk.net].
# Open the file that you downloaded (with Java). If done correctly, the installer window should appear.
# Click "OK".
# Open the Minecraft launcher (closing it first if it was already open).
# A new Forge installation profile should appear. Select it, put the mods you want to use into a "mods" folder in your Minecraft directory (instructions on how to find it [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/.minecraft here]), and you're ready to play!

A word of safety: <span style='color:#dd2423'><b>NEVER</b></span> download mods or mod loaders from websites you don't trust! At best, this can lead to installing malware and viruses; at worst, you can lose your Minecraft account. For your safety (and everyone else's), only download mods from the websites listed below unless you are sure you know what you're doing.

== OptiFine ==

OptiFine is probably the most popular and most downloaded mod for Minecraft. It's been around since Minecraft Beta 1.7.3, and was originally a great mod with many optimisations, features, and quality of life improvements. However, in recent years, it's benefits have dwindled and causes many incompatibilities with other mods due to it replacing large amounts of code and being closed-source. In the modern Minecraft modding era, with the Fabric mod loader and community, open-source mods exist to replace most of OptiFine's features. Other mods that optimise the game more than OptiFine exist too, and they work in a way that's more compatible with other mods.

It's not recommended to use OptiFine anymore, but it is allowed <span style='color:#dd2423'><b>as long as Options -> Video Settings -> Performance -> Fast Math is set to OFF</b></span> (reason why [https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/5583 here]). [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric OptiFabric] is a mod which allows you to use OptiFine on the Fabric mod loader (it isn't supported natively), and is also allowed, though not recommended.

=== How to Download OptiFine Safely ===
# Go to the download page on [https://optifine.net/downloads optifine.net].
# Find the version you want to download in the versions list.
# Right click the "(mirror)" button link to the right of the "Download" button for the version you want to download.
# A context menu should have appeared. In it should be an option called something like "Open Link in New Tab". Click it.
# You should now be on the page with the download link. Click it. There are ads here, so be very careful to click on the right link.
# You should get a file called something like `OptiFine_<minecraft_version>_HD_U_<letter><number>.jar`.

=== How to Install OptiFine Standalone ===
# Open the installer .jar file. To do this you'll need to install Java first, which you can do from [https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot adoptopenjdk.net].
# Click "Install".
# Open the Minecraft launcher (closing it first if it was already open).
# A new OptiFine installation profile should appear. Select it, and you're ready to play!

== Allowed Mods ==

=== Performance ===

Despite being a simple-looking block game, Minecraft can actually be quite difficult to run because it is incredibly unoptimised. Luckily, the community have recognised this and created mods to help. These mods don't affect gameplay, and only exist to improve performance and so are okay to use on the server.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium Sodium] ([https://github.com/IrisShaders/sodium-fabric Iris Fork], [https://github.com/HyperCubeMC/sodium-fabric Starline Iris Fork]) - Rendering engine and client-side optimisation mod, usually even better than OptiFine.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium Lithium] - Server-side optimisation mod, however still providing some benefit when used on a client to join a non-integrated server.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor Phosphor] - Lighting engine optimisation mod.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/hydrogen Hydrogen] - Memory optimisation mod, particularly effective in highly modded scenarios.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight Starlight] - Lighting engine replacement mod. This provides significantly better performance than Phosphor, but at the cost of potential mod incompatibility.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core FerriteCore] - Memory optimisation mod, generally more effective than Hydrogen and is compatible with Hydrogen.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu LazyDFU] - Startup optimisation mod, providing a significant speed-up in the time it takes to start the game by not compiling DataFixerUpper rules until they're actually needed.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps Dynamic FPS] - Renders Minecraft at 1fps (or not at all) when the Minecraft window isn't focused, as well as improving background performance.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/ebe Enhanced Block Entities] - Improves performance (and slightly visuals) by rendering block entities (such as beds and chests) as normal blocks unless they need to animate (such as when opening a chest).

While OptiFine is not recommended to be used, you can still use most of its features by using a mod from this list that adds the feature you want to use.
* [https://modrinth.com/mod/iris Iris] ([https://github.com/HyperCubeMC/Iris Starline Fork])- A shader mod with support for OptiFine format shader packs. It's compatible with (and includes by default) Sodium, allowing for much better performance when using shaders than OptiFine.
