# Autcraft Approved Mods Utils

A bunch of utilities for interacting with [Autcraft's approved mods list](https://www.autcraft.com/wiki/m/34575523/page/Approved_Mods). :)

~~More to come!~~ Actually maybe not, I'm not exactly sure what utilities I would even make... Anything that would be possibly useful would be rather complicated to do, and likely be more annoying and slower than just doing it manually. I don't think much will happen with this, it was a nice idea but not really practical or actually useful.
